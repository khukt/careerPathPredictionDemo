# Career Path Recommendation System

## Overview
The Career Path Recommendation System is a demo application that helps users explore potential career paths based on their current occupation and skill set. The app uses a dataset of skills and occupations to provide recommendations and highlight skill gaps for the transition to a new career.

## About the Dataset
The dataset used in this app consists of skills and occupation data sourced from reliable databases, including O*NET. Each occupation is associated with various skills, with importance and level values provided for each skill.

## Model Used
This app uses the Cosine Similarity model to calculate the similarity between different occupations based on their skill requirements. This allows us to recommend career paths that require similar skill sets.

## Disclaimer
This application is a demo and should be used for informational purposes only. The recommendations provided are based on the available data and are meant to serve as a guide. Users are advised to perform further research and consider additional factors when making career decisions.
